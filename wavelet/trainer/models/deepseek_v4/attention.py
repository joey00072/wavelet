"""Packed sliding-window and compressed DeepSeek-V4 attention.

All layers share a local causal window, a learned sink, shared keys/values,
interleaved RoPE and grouped output projection. CSA selects compressed entries
with a Lightning Indexer; HCA reads every causally available compressed entry.
The output is de-rotated because values carry the same RoPE as keys.

PackedContext derives document-local positions, RoPE and causal window indices
from sequence lengths. CompressionLayout groups complete compress_rate-sized
chunks within each document; trailing partial chunks are omitted. Entry indices
and token indices remain global, while positions restart at document boundaries.

SparseAttnInputs concatenates token KV with compressed KV. Its int32 indices
address this buffer, with local-window slots first and compressed picks after.
IGNORE_SLOT (-1) masks absent keys without reading their values.
